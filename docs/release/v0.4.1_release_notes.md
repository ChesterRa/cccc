# CCCC v0.4.1 Release Notes

`v0.4.1` is a stabilization release after the `v0.4.0` launch.
It focuses on operational correctness, safer secret workflows, and tighter docs parity.

## Highlights

## 1) Lifecycle correctness and event consistency

Actor/group lifecycle handling was hardened so state transitions and emitted events stay aligned.
This reduces drift between runtime truth and observer surfaces (Web/MCP/stream consumers), especially around start/stop/restart paths.

## 2) Automation semantics tightened around idle operation

Automation behavior under `idle` state was clarified and aligned with explicit group-state semantics.
The result is more predictable reminder behavior and fewer operator surprises in long-running groups.

## 3) Safer secret operations in Web flows

Web actor editing now shows **masked secret previews** for configured keys.
Operators can verify that the intended key/value shape exists without any plaintext exposure.

Security posture remains unchanged:

- secret values are never returned as plaintext
- write-only private env storage is preserved
- masked previews are metadata-only UX

## 4) Terminal/runtime guardrails

Terminal maintenance and resize-related handling received additional hardening.
This reduces fragile behavior under mixed runtime conditions and lowers regression risk for active sessions.

## 5) Documentation and distribution polish

`v0.4.1` also refreshes outward-facing assets:

- updated README surfaces and release hub references
- SDK entry-point visibility improved
- project logo assets integrated consistently across docs/web

## Validation Summary

Release preparation checks passed on the branch:

- `pytest -q` -> `146 passed`
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
- `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
- `npm --prefix docs run build` -> pass

## Upgrade Notes

From `v0.4.0`, this is a drop-in minor upgrade.
No migration procedure is required.

Recommended post-upgrade checks:

1. restart daemon/web once to ensure clean runtime state
2. verify actor lifecycle behavior in one test group (start/stop/restart)
3. confirm masked secret previews appear as expected in Web actor edit
